//1. Make a list called favoriteFoods and store at least six of your favorite foods in the list


//2. Print out each of your favorite foods in the console saying "My favorite food is ________"




// 3. Let's expand the dialogue - For each food in the list, print out three lines.
//     "Have you ever tried ___?"
//     "I really recommend that you try _____."
//     "_____ is delicious."






//  4a. Now for each food in that list, let's be specific about how MUCH you likes them each We'll do this without iteration first.
//  For example, print out "Steven's #1 favorite food is Sushi" and then "Steven's #2 favorite food is Pizza" and so on until you've made an ordered list.
// To start, you can copy-paste this line as many times as you need, and make small adjustments:
//
//  console.log(`Steven's #1 favorite food is ${favoriteFoods[0]}`)




// # 4b. Now comment out the above code, and try doing the same thing with a loop - you will likely need fewer lines of code.
// # This can be done a number of different ways, but the easiest is probably by iterating over each index in the favoriteFoods and modifying i to represent the value you are currently at. Explore documentation for this!





// # 5. Below is a massive list of numbers. Iterate over the list and print out only the numbers less than 100. Put all these in a lessThanOneHundred list.
var lessThanOneHundred = [];
var manyNumbers = [109, 141, 44, 51, 133, 366, 339, 248, 226, 321, 97, 195, 245, 252, 238, 1, 366, 47, 189, 91, 148, 88, 194, 106, 5, 128, 165, 337, 380, 181, 143, 95];




// # 6. Now iterate over the list but print out only the even ones. Put all of these in an evenNumbers list
var evenNumbers = []




// # 7. Below is a list of 99 names. Iterate over them all and print out only the names that include the letter "a". Store these names in a list called namesWithA

// 8. Now iterate over the list and print out only the names which have more than 6 letters in them. Store these names in a list called longNames




// 9. Iterate over the list and find the longest name in the whole thing. 
// Then print out "The longest name in the list is ______. It has ___ letters in it."





// 10. Make a second list called shortNames that contains all names that are 6 letters or shorter






// 11. Print out the longNames and shortNames lists.




// 12. Are there more long names or short names? Write code to figure that out.





// CHALLENGE: Iterate over the list of numbers to find the average of them all.





//DOUBLE TRIPPLE BONUS CHALLENGE: Find all duplicated names on the list and return the number of times each name is duplicated in the manyNames list.
